# `SMTP` Help

## Overview

Sending emails from APL code (or any code) is, thanks to the spammers, surprisingly difficult.

However, there is a solution: the `SMTP` package from the Tatin server. It works out of the box; the README.md document carries information for how to send yourself an email with a single command after loading the package.

## User Guide

### Preconditions

You are free to use any public SMTP server of course, but in the function `SendEmailExample` as well as in its test cases `SMTP` uses Google's SMTP server `https://smtp.google.com`.

### Send an email out of the box

You can use the `SendEmailExample` function in order to send emails out of the box:

```
   SMTP.SendEmailExample 'john.doe@whatever.com'
```

That will send a simple test email to the address provided.

You may add one or more files as attachments:

```
   ('my.txt' 'foo.htm') SMTP.SendEmailExample 'john.doe@whatever.com'
```

This uses hard-coded credentials. The email address is only suitable for tests, don't use it for anything else!
Be aware that the credentials might well change in case somebody abuses this, or the email address might disappear altogether.

### Using smtp.google.com yourself

It's easy enough to take advantage of smtp.google.com youself. The first thing you need is a Gmail address. 

We suggest to create a new one because that way you don't need to worry too much about safety. The worst thing that can happen is that you lose that GMail address. Well, just create a new one then.

Of course this implies that you should not use such an email address for anything remotely confidential, but for sending, say, a crash notification it's absolutely fine.

However, just creating the email address is not enough: you also need to allow access in a way that Google considers unsafe, which is the reason why it is not active by default.

In order to enable it follow these steps:

1. Log on

2. Select "Setting" ==> "See all setting"

3. Go to the tab "Accounts and Import"

4. Under "Change account settings" click "Other Google Account settings"

5. On the left click "Security"

6. Close to the bottom there is a section "Less secure app access" - you must enable this, otherwise you will always get an error 535 (Bad credentials) when you try to send an email to this address.

**Note that this is a valid description as of 2021-09.** It might well change, and this recipe is not going to be updated. However, you should be able to find your way, as long as the general machanism is still working.

### Usage

Steps to send an email:

1. Create an instance of the `ConnectionParameters` class.

2. Make amendments according to your needs.

3. Create an instance of the `Connection` class by providing the instance of the `ConnectionParms` class.

4. Create an instance of the `MailParameters` class.

5. Make amendments according to your needs.

6. Optionally add attachments. 

   This can be done by calling the `AddAttachment` method of the instance of the `MailParameters` class. In case no instance of the `AddAttachment` is passed as argument to `AddAttachment` it will internally create one from the argument.

   `AddAttachment` accepts three different arguments:

   * The attachment's filename. This is particularly useful under Windows because the `Attachment` class will work out the appropriate MIME type according to the extension.

   * The attachment's filename and its MIME type as two text vectors. Use this in case there is no extension.

   * An instance of the `Attachment` class.

7. Call the `Send` method of the instance of the `Connection` class and pass the instance of the `MailParameters` class as an argument. This method will send the email.

Notes:

* When properties of the classes `ConnectionParameters`, `MailParameters` and `Attachment` are set or changed they are checked straight away, so the user will be told immediately when she did something wrong.

* Both classes `ConnectionParameters` and `MailParameters` offer a method `PerformChecks` which makes sure that all required properties have reasonable values, and that the setting of the properties is consistent.

  You don't have to call these methods because `SMTP` will do this anyway, but you may if you wish.
